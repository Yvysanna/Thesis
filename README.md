# Thesis
This project contains all code, requests and data I used to collect, analyze and visualize data for my thesis

The thesis contributes to algorithm studies, analyzing potential gender bias within the recommender systems on the music platform Spotify.

Through investigative research and comparison between content recommended to two accounts from users of different genders, I outline significant differences in how far both users were given differently personalized content. My research aims to follow the debate that algorithms are reflective of ideologies curated within societal realities, contributing to bias. Furthermore, research on gender bias concerning musical content is still very limited in academia.
