This directory contains all data used and extracted in this research.

Especially female.csv and male.csv are the main datasets based on which data analysis is conducted. They contain all information extracted from the screenshots and for some content, extra metadata, which made for example the visualization or further analysis possible.

### daily mixes
Contains the extracted daily mixes / algorithmically generated playlists, for both accounts
In the preliminary research idea it was planned to analyze those, but in the final research they have not been looked at

### screenshots
Contains all screenshots which account for all the data in the spreadsheets. Since images are an inconvenient format for computational analysis, I have created the spreadsheets which can be found in the data directory, in female.csv and male.csv .

### visual
Contains all images (plots) that are being generated through the data analysis script
